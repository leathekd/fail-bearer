# fail-bearer

You killed the build and fail-bearer is the bearer of that bad news.

It will post an image to the Github failed pull request.  You can
configure what images will be posted and it's recommended that they be
amusing animated gifs.  Possibly with cats.

## Usage

For now, fill out `resources/config.edn` and `lein run`.

## TODO
- Proper daemonization
